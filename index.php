		<p>Hello viewer, my name is David Gilliam and welcome to my portfolio.<p> 


		<h5>About me:</h5>
 		<p>I was born May 22, 1990, currently 25 years old. I have an 
 			awesome daughter named Alena. Currently I am enrolled at Fullsail University 
 			and set to graduate at the end of October with my Bachelors of Science (Web Development).</p>

		<h5>Hobbies:</h5>
		<p>Some things I like to do are, watch football, play with my awesome dog name Megatron, play 
			video games, play doc McStuffins with my daughter, coding and creating. There are loads of 
			other things I like, but I don't want to bore you any longer. </p>

		<h5>Development:</h5>
		<p>People ask if I like back-end or front-end coding? The answer is, I plead the fifth. 
		I pretty much enjoy both equally, there is always something new and exciting. With front-end 
		web development, you are able to see your creation come alive. People can visually see your
		 work and see your vision. With back-end, there is always a challenge. I like getting stuck and 
		 figuring out the problem, helps with problem solving abilities and much more. </p>
